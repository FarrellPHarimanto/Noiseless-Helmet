# Noiseless-Helmet

The aim of this project is to make a more comfortable and safe helmet for motorcycle riders, by using Active noise Cancellation we filter unnecessary noises from the road to make it more comfortable for the rider and let noises such as vehicle horns, and other necessary noises be heard for safety.
